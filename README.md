# htmlextractpython
This is a simple Python Script to extract information from live web pages

Purpose
- Learn a little python
- Automate a manual process I sometime have to do for friends and family

The idea is to write a general python script that will extract and then export the information you have identified from a live page within any type of element, either with a specific ID or Class or element type. 

Like to do Later:
- Process and alter the data exported to csv or another html file with further styling if possible.
- Expand to more than one type or series of data.
